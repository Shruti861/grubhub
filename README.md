# Grubhub
Welcome to the Grubhub Recipe Platform!

Our platform allows users to search for different possible recipes that are available in our database by simply selecting the ingredients that they have available with them at the moment. Conventional methods of accessing recipes by recipe name, or cuisine type are also available. Users can also contribute their own recipes by filling out the "Add Recipe" form, which is available on the home page. Once submitted, the recipe will be added to the platform if it meets the all the pre-defined criteria.

To help users stay up to date with the latest recipes added, we offer a "Recently Added" page. This page showcases the most recent recipes added to the platform.

If users have any questions or concerns, our FAQ page is available for quick reference. We encourage users to review this page before submitting any inquiries, as it may answer their questions.

The website has various features like voice search, recipe audiobook, multi-lingual features, etc., which make it very user-friendly and interactive.

Thank you for using Grubhub Recipe Platform, and we hope you enjoy discovering new recipes!
