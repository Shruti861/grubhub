Welcome to the Grubhub Recipe Platform!

Our platform allows users to search for recipes by ingredient name, recipe name, or cuisine type on the home page. Users can also contribute their own recipes by filling out the "Add Recipe" form, which is available on the home page. Once submitted, the recipe will be reviewed by our team and added to the platform if it meets our criteria.

To help users stay up to date with the latest recipe additions, we offer a "Recently Added" page. This page showcases the most recent recipes added to the platform.

If users have any questions or concerns, our FAQ page is available for quick reference. We encourage users to review this page before submitting any inquiries, as it may answer their questions.

Thank you for using Grubhub Recipe Platform, and we hope you enjoy discovering new recipes!
